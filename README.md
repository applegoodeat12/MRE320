# IMU SENSOR

IMU sensor has a wide range of applications in life, ranging from airplanes and rockets to smartphones and smart watches. Soï¼Œit is an interesting sensor.

The IMU sensor we studied is called GY-521. First, we studied some characteristics of the IUM sensor, and its main feature is its 3-axis gyroscope and the 3-axis accelerometer, which can measure angular velocity and acceleration at the same time. Based on these two features, we connect the IMU sensor fixed on the breadboard to the encoder, and then use Arduino to program code and read data. Through the reading of the encoder, we can get a standard value and compare it with the reading of the IMU sensor. You can learn about our specific experimental process in the files we upload.
